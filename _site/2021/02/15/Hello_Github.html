		<h1>Hello_github</h1>
<p>15 Feb 2021 - Nai</p>

<p>I’m experimenting with getting a github.io website up and running. I’m currently looking at using Jekyll to generate the site, mainly because it’s a new tool for me and it reminds me of my previous experiments with Django, at least in terms of the templating language.</p>

<p>I’m also using this as an opportunity to get experience with Linux tools and Ubuntu; I’m writing this post in vim via the Linux Subsystem for Windows ( I do have a proper Ubuntu machine as well, but Windows is still my daily driver ).</p>

<p>I’m quite enjoying vim - the key combos that let me make rapid edits and jump around the document make me feel like a pro, though I think I might have to invest in a printout cheatsheet to be able to consistently remember a lot of the specific key combinations.</p>
