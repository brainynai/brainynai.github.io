I'm experimenting with getting a github.io website up and running. I'm currently looking at using Jekyll to generate the site, mainly because it's a new tool for me and it reminds me of my previous experiments with Django, at least in terms of the templating language. 

I'm also using this as an opportunity to get experience with Linux tools and Ubuntu; I'm writing this post in vim via the Linux Subsystem for Windows ( I do have a proper Ubuntu machine as well, but Windows is still my daily driver ). 

I'm quite enjoying vim - the key combos that let me make rapid edits and jump around the document make me feel like a pro, though I think I might have to invest in a printout cheatsheet to be able to consistently remember a lot of the specific key combinations.
